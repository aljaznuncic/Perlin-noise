# Perlin noise

## About

This program is built on the basis of [Coding train, Challange #24](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/024-perlinnoiseflowfield.html). 
The program allows you to control Perlin noise with the help of sound that the device receives through the microphone.
The program is available at https://aljaznuncic.github.io/Perlin-noise and the source code at https://github.com/aljaznuncic/Perlin-noise.

The project was created within the subject Interaction and Information Design at the [Faculty of Computer and Information Science](https://fri.uni-lj.si/), [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/).
The article of the project is available [here](filesForReadme/article.md) (the article is written in Slovenian).

Videos showing the operation of the program are available [here](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/an2006_student_uni-lj_si/Eg0AY_xmPH1Hg3-keNVqx3wBx2FRvHMfU0m9yqJ6l3pzuw?e=Mjw1TW).
